This is a mini visual novel based on the myth of the Minotaur. In this game, you take the place of the hero Theseus, that enters the labyrinth as one of the Athenian sacrifices that were sent annually to be devoured by the creature. Then, you'll have a conversation with the half-man, half-bull monster, that can goes different ways based on your chosen response. 

It was my first experience with Unity and game development, so it has a few resolution issues, especially when running on a mobile device. But it was really fun to make and I dedicated a lot of time to all aspects of this game, from the code to the visuals and the soundtrack/sound effects.

The game was developed as part of an assessment activity for my literacy degree final project, which was a lecture on "Oral literature: the myth of the Minotaur and its representations in contemporary times".
